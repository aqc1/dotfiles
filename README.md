# Dotfiles

> Anthony Cleary | 4 May 2022

Just my dotfiles, feel free to use and/or modify as you wish.

Cannot guarentee they work perfectly.

* `bash_alias`: Holds list of quality of life bash aliases
* `gdbinit`: Mainly just so GDB automatically switches to Intel syntax
* `tmux.conf`: My attempt to begin to relearn tmux; inspired by one of ippsec's videos
* `vimrc`: Simple config to make vim a little better
